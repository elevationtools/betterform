Commands:

  up: Wraps terraform apply
  down: Wraps terraform destroy
  init:
    Wraps terraform init. Uses the .terraform.lock.hcl in the current working
    directory.
  stamp:
    stamp the 'template' directory in the current working directory using
    gomplate.

Any commands that depend on others to run have their dependency run first
automatically.  For example "up" will trigger "init" first.
